# Sales-Dashboard

This is a project that i carried out in my early stages of data analysis. It entails analysing a comprehensive sales insight and creating a highly interactive dashboard to visualise the data using Microsoft Excel only.

*Data was gotten from Leanexcel Solutions*
*Dataset contained a 2-year sales record of a Supermarket showing price, cost, category, mode of purchase and Date*
*Formulas such as Offset, Xlookup and basic Excel formulas were used to gain insights on the data*
*Analysis was carried out using Pivot tables and form controls was used to make visualisation more dynamic*
